# Weekly nerd
I have learned a lot during the minor webdevelopment, some things from working with Javascript mot most from working with HTML and CSS. Because I study software enginering and I already knew some things about coding I have chosen to focus this minor more on the creative classes. for this reason I want to write three articles about things I found most intresting of the things I have learned during this minor.

## Display attribute
### Display block 
The display attribute is a very handy css tool you can use to moddify the behavour of an element. Most of the common elements are a block element which means they have the same width as their parent width, and apear as a list under eachother with their siblings. Some examples of common block elements are: main, article, section, div, h1 and p.

### Display inline
There are some exeptions, some elememts are not a block element, because they are an inline element. This means that they are not 100% of their parent width and apear next to eachother.  




### Display flex
